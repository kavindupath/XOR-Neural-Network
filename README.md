# XOR-Neural-Network
Simple neural network build to train the function of a XOR Gate 

This is my first neural network I trained to give output for a XOR Gate based on the input data given

I write this code,trained and test it on Python IDLE(Python 3.6 64 Bit version)

First I added the relevant Python libraries,tensorflow,keras 

Here the Keras is a Python library that used tensorflow as backend 

Then I import the keras layers and Models as given in the code

Create a dataset:
My input data is given as variable x and the relevant outputs are given as variable Y

Buid the neural Network Model:
Model is a Sequential Model and I added 2 layes with 16 Denses to the input layer and 1 Dense for the output layer

Compile the model:
Then the model was compiled using adam optimizer 

Train the Model:
Model was then trained upto 500 epcohs
